## The size-Ramsey number of powers of bounded degree trees
With S. Berger, Y. Kohayakawa, G. S. Maesaka, T. Martins, G. O. Mota and O. Parczyk.
*Submitted. [arXiv:1907.03466](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03466)*
**ABSTRACT:**
  > Given a positive integer $s$, the \textit{$s$-colour size-Ramsey number} of a graph $H$ is the smallest integer $m$ such that there exists a graph $G$ with $m$ edges with the property that, in any colouring of $E(G)$ with $s$ colours, there is a monochromatic copy of $H$. We prove that, for any positive integers $k$ and $s$, the $s$-colour size-Ramsey number of the $k$th power of any $n$-vertex bounded degree tree is linear in $n$. As a corollary we obtain that the $s$-colour size-Ramsey number of $n$-vertex graphs with bounded treewidth and bounded degree is linear in $n$, which answers a question raised by Kam\v{c}ev, Liebenau, Wood and Yepremyan.

## Tiling edge-coloured graphs with few monochromatic bounded-degree graphs
With J. Corsten.
*In preparation*
**ABSTRACT:**
  > We prove that for all integers $\Delta,r \geq 2$, there is a constant $C = C(\Delta,r) >0$ such that the following is true for every sequence $\mathcal{F} = \{F_1, F_2, \ldots\}$ of graphs with $v(F_n) = n$ and $\Delta(F_n) \leq \Delta$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. In every $r$-edge-coloured $K_n$, there is a collection of at most $C$ monochromatic copies from $\mathcal{F}$ whose vertex-sets partition $V(K_n)$. This makes progress on a conjecture of Grinshpun and S\'ark\"ozy.

## Covering $3$-coloured random graphs with monochromatic trees
With Y. Kohayakawa, G. O. Mota and B. Sch\"{u}lke.
*In prepartion*
**ABSTRACT:**
  > We investigate the problem of determining how many monochromatic trees are necessary to cover the vertices of an edge-coloured random graph. More precisely, we show that for $p\gg \left(\frac{\ln n}{n}\right)^{1/6}$, in any $3$-colouring of the random graph $G(n,p)$ we can find $3$ monochromatic trees such that their union covers all vertices. This improves, for three colours, a result of Buci\'c, Kor\'andi and Sudakov.

## Asymmetric Ramsey Properties of Random Graphs Involving Cliques and Cycles
With A. Liebenau, L. Mattos and J. Skokan.
*In preparation*
**ABSTRACT:**
  > We prove that for every $\ell,r \geq 3$, there exists $c>0$ such that for $p \leq cn^{-1/m_2(K_r,C_{\ell})}$, with high probability there is a 2-edge-colouring of the random graph $G(n,p)$ with no monochromatic copy of $K_r$ of the first colour and no monochromatic copy of $C_\ell$ of the second colour. This makes progress on a conjecture of Kohayakawa and Kreuter.

## On the anti-Ramsey threshold for non-balanced graphs
With P. AraÃºjo, Y. Kohayakawa, T. Martins, L. Mattos, L. Moreira, and G. O. Mota.
*In preparation*
**ABSTRACT:**
  > A graph $G$ has the anti-Ramsey property with respect to a graph $H$ if any proper edge-colouring of $G$ contains a rainbow copy of $H$, i.e., a copy where no colour appears more than once. For a general graph $H$, the current best upper bound regarding the threshold in the random graph $G(n,p)$ for the anti-Ramsey property with respect to $H$ is given in terms of the so-called 2-density of $H$. Recently, Kohayakawa, Konstadinidis and Mota presented an infinite family of graphs such that the threshold function for the anti-Ramsey property with respect to those graphs is asymptotically smaller than the upper bound given by the 2-density. Generalizing their result, we devise a framework that provides a richer and more complex family of such examples which includes all the previous known ones.
