# Walner Mendon√ßa

I am a final-year PhD student in pure mathematics at [IMPA](https://impa.br/en_US/), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under the supervision of [Rob Morris](http://w3.impa.br/~rob/). My research interests are in the areas of extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, Ramsey theory and random graphs.
