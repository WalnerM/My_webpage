I am a young Brazilian mathematician looking for a new institution. I was a Doctorate student at <a href="https://impa.br/en_US/">IMPA</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://w3.impa.br/~rob/">Rob Morris</a>. My research interests are in the areas of extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, Ramsey theory and random graphs.
